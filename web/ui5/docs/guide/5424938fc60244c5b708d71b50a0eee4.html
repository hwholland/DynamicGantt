	<h1 class="title topictitle1">How the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> Text Repository
		Works</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If you cannot use the recommended translation approach, the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> tools for Eclipse provide a
		fallback mechanism, where the translated texts are not stored in properties files, but in
		the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository. </p>

		<p class="p">To use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository,
			you have to set up default properties files in a special way which identifies it as
			relevant for the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text
			repository (details see below). If you submit a default properties file like this to the
				<span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository,
			the texts stored in this default properties file are written to the language-dependent
			database tables of the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span>
			text repository as well as to a transport request. The master language of the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository is taken
			as the master language for the submitted texts. As usual for language-dependent database
			tables, the texts can then be translated using transaction <samp class="ph codeph">SE63</samp>,
			usually in a separate system. Once the translated texts are transported back to the
			respective systems, they can be accessed at runtime when texts in a certain language are
			requested.</p>

		<p class="p">To use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository,
			you have to add the following key as the first line in the properties file with texts
			that you submit to the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span>
			ABAP repository:</p>

		<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph"># SAPUI5 TRANSLATION-KEY &lt;GUID with 32 characters&gt;</samp></p>

		<p class="p">You can create the GUID with the ABAP function module <samp class="ph codeph">GUID_CREATE</samp>, or you can
			create the complete line with the ABAP report
				<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/TEXT_FILE_GEN_TRANS_KEY</samp>. (A UUID as used in Java is also
			supported.)</p>

		<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">The GUID serves as a unique identifier for the properties file. Never change the GUID or copy
				it to other properties files.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">The properties file has to fulfil the following rules:</p>

		<div class="p">
			<ul class="ul" id="loio5424938fc60244c5b708d71b50a0eee4__ul_rls_lxg_bt">
				<li class="li">It doesn't contain any duplicate text elements.</li>

				<li class="li">The text must be on one line and can have a maximum of 255 characters.</li>

				<li class="li">A text type is assigned to every text element.</li>

			</ul>

		</div>

		<p class="p">Accidental overwriting of texts in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository with texts
			from other properties files is prevented. If a duplicate GUID is detected, the
			properties files cannot be synchronized. It's not possible to rename or relocate a
			properties file and to submit it once it's contained in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository. Before
			you can rename or relocate a properties file, you have to remove the texts from the
				<span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository by
			using the report <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/TEXT_ENTRIES_DELETE</samp>.</p>

		<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">If you run this report, all translated texts get lost. That's why you use this report
				only for texts that are not yet translated.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">After running the report, submit the renamed or relocated properties file again.</p>

		<p class="p">If you reassign the BSP application on the ABAP server (representing a single <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repository) from a local
				(<samp class="ph codeph">$TMP</samp>) package to a non-local package, you also need to resubmit
			the properties file. All text elements are generated again with the new creation time
			stamp.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">Since the master language of the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository serves
				as the master language of the texts (see above), it's important that you use the
				same language for the creation of the repository that was used for the properties
				files.When you use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repository team
				provider and create the BSP application manually, you have to choose the correct
				language on the logon screen.</p>
