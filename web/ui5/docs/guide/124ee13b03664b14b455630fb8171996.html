	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><samp class="ph codeph">Upload Collection</samp> is a list control for attachment management that
		provides the ability to upload, edit or delete attachments.</p>

		<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control allows users to upload single or multiple files
			from their devices (desktop PC, tablet or phone) to an app. Due to its responsiveness,
			the upload collection can be used in containers of different sizes.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Overview</div><div type="Overview">
			
			<p class="p">You can use the <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control to show a list of files, for
				example, attachments or uploads, that can be modified, or you can allow users to add
				or remove files to or from this list. </p>

			<div class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control can be used in the following scenarios:<ul class="ul" id="loio124ee13b03664b14b455630fb8171996__ul_m3m_c5h_ys">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Instant Upload</span></p>

						<p class="p">Allows users to upload single or multiple files from their devices and attach them to the
							application immediately. The selection and upload process is completed
							in one step and is automatically triggered by the
								<samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Upload Pending</span></p>

						<p class="p">Users can select attachments and add them to the upload list (multiple selection is
							possible). It is possible to cancel the upload of one file in this
							selection without canceling the upload of the other selected files. In a
							second step, the user uploads the selected files. The application
							triggers the upload with an event. </p>

					</li>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Features</div><div type="Features">
			
			<ul class="ul" id="loio124ee13b03664b14b455630fb8171996__ul_y4f_pk5_rv">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Upload files</span></p>

					<p class="p">The upload is triggered by the <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span> pushbutton (plus
						icon). In the OS-native file picker dialog you can select one or multiple
						files. However, the consuming application need to enable the upload of
						multiple files by using the <samp class="ph codeph">multiple</samp> property during the
						instantiation. During the upload process, a progress indicator provides
						information about the status.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Open files</span></p>

					<p class="p">To open a listed file, you can choose the icon or thumbnail of the attachment
						as well as the filename itself. Depending on the file extension, browser
						capabilities, and device type (PC or mobile), the file is handled
						differently, for example, it is opened in a new tab or downloaded, if no
						display capability is available in the browser.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Rename files</span></p>

					<p class="p">Choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Rename</span> pushbutton (pen icon) turns the
						file name into an input field and allows modification. If the
							<samp class="ph codeph">sameFilenameAllowed</samp> property is set to
							<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>, the new file name is validated and, if the file
						name already exists in the current list, an error occurs, which indicates
						that you need to change the file name.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Delete files</span></p>

					<p class="p">You can delete files by using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> pushbutton (x
						icon with a circle). After choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>
						pushbutton, a dialog appears, asking the user to confirm the deletion of the
						respective file that removes the file from the list.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">For the instant upload scenario only, the following features are available:</p>

					<ul class="ul" id="loio124ee13b03664b14b455630fb8171996__ul_c41_vjv_rv">
						<li class="li">
							<p class="p">Download files</p>

							<p class="p">You can download a file item from the Upload Collection list and save
								it on your device or desktop. For example, you can provide a
									<span class="ph uicontrol">Download</span> pushbutton in the header, and
								once you marked one of the items the download feature can be used.
								To use this feature, API methods in the
									<samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control and the
									<samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollectionItem</samp> control are used. Using
								the <samp class="ph codeph">askForLocation</samp> parameter, you can configure
								that the browser should ask for the location where to store the file
								or not (depending on the browser). When this parameter is set to
									<samp class="ph codeph">false</samp>, the download method acts in the same way
								as when clicking on the file link. If the
									<samp class="ph codeph">askForLocation</samp> parameter is set to
									<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>, the browser opens a <span class="ph uicontrol">Save
									As</span> dialog.</p>

						</li>

						<li class="li">
							<p class="p">Upload new version of file</p>

							<p class="p">To upload a new version of a file to the Upload Collection list, the
									<samp class="ph codeph">openFileDialog</samp> method is available. You can
								provide a pushbutton in the header area and if one entry in the
								Upload Collection list is selected, the API method shall be called.
								The uploading process of the new version depends on the settings for
								the optional <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollectionItem</samp> parameter: If the
								parameter is provided, the method removes the selected item from the
								Upload Collection list automatically to upload the new version. If
								the parameter is not provided, the select dialog of the operating
								system opens and the further steps have to be proceeded manually by
								the user.</p>

							<p class="p">The detailed behavior of the feature depends on the app, in which the
								control is used.</p>
