			<p class="p">There are two different tutorial formats: Some tutorials start with an empty project and let you develop the whole app step by step, others start
				with an initial project in the first step that you can download from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app in the Demo Kit. You use the code
				from this initial project as a starting point for the subsequent tutorial steps.</p>

			<p class="p">Each step of the tutorial starts with a preview of the user interface (UI) which shows how it will look like after the step is accomplished.</p>

			<p class="p">It then displays the files that have to be changed in the step, highlighting the changed code, along with an explanation of the entire
				process.</p>

			<p class="p">You can view and download the files for all steps in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app in the Demo Kit. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span>
				app always contain the latest version of the sample code. So if you find differences to the coding in the step description, follow the version
				in <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span>. Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and configuration

				<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step you want. Just download the code from the

			<div class="p">You might have to adapt parts of the coding to your local development environment to make the app work. Please check the following settings
					carefully:<ul class="ul" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__ul_gnb_qyf_rs">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Project Path and Deployment</span></p>

						<p class="p">All tutorials assume that the app is deployed and can be accessed under a certain path on a Web server. You will not be able to run
							the app without a Web server as the browser does not allow you to load the required resources locally due to security restrictions. </p>

						<p class="p">Depending on your server configuration and deployment mode, you will either have to include or exclude the <samp class="ph codeph">webapp</samp>
							folder in your URL path. If you choose to deploy the app to another path, you will have to adapt the file paths and URLs
							accordingly.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>
							Resources</span></p>

						<p class="p">You can either download and deploy the runtime to your (local) Web server or reference the CDN version located at <span class="ph filepath">https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js</span>. Some development environments such as the <span class="ph pname">SAP Web
								IDE</span> also provide a local runtime for testing purposes. If you download the code from the samples in the
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app, you will have to adapt the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">resource path in the bootstrap section</span> of
							all HTML pages included in the project. In the tutorial code, we assume that <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> can be accessed from the
								<samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> path of the server.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Accessing Remote Services</span></p>

						<p class="p">Browsers typically prevent accessing remote resources due to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. If you would like to
							call a real service or remote resources, you will have to either configure the development environment or the remote server to
							accept these requests. This strongly depends on the development environment and is described in more detail below.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__tutorials_troubleshooting"><div class="section_title">Troubleshooting</div><div type="Troubleshooting">
			
			<div class="p">If you get stuck on a certain tutorial step, please have a look at the developer console of your browser. Are there log messages displayed
				related to the error? Did it work before, and your recent change broke the app? Try reverting the previous change and test if the app can be run
				again. The most common errors are as follows:<ul class="ul" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__ul_mdw_q1g_rs">

							<samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core.js</samp> is probably incorrect and needs to point to the path where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> resources are located
							(typically globally under <samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> or locally under <samp class="ph codeph">resources</samp>).<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
								<p class="p">If you are running the tutorial in <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>, you will have to configure the project descriptor
										<samp class="ph codeph">neo-app.json</samp>. In this descriptor file, the path to the resources is already configured. Other
									development environments might need the resources to be copied to the server. Alternatively, you can use the CDN version of

</div>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">No texts from the resource bundle are displayed in the app</span></p>

						<p class="p">You are running the tutorial with an outdated version of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>. Most tutorials need to
							be run with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> version 1.30 or higher,
							because the models are instantiated by the <samp class="ph codeph">manifest.json</samp> descriptor file. This feature is not available in release
							1.28 and thus the models will not be loaded. As a workaround, you can instantiate the models manually in the <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp>
							method of the app component.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">No model data in the application when trying to access a real service</span></p>

						<div class="p">Modern browsers prevent calling files and services from another server due to security restrictions. When accessing a remote service,
							you configure your application project or the remote server accordingly. Otherwise you will get a log message telling you that
							Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not configured and calling the remote URL is not allowed.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
								<p class="p">The configuration for calling remote services strongly depends on your development environment. All tutorials can be called
									with local test data instead if you are having trouble accessing a real service. Typically, the HTML page for running the
									app with local test data is called <samp class="ph codeph">testService.html</samp> and located in the <samp class="ph codeph">test</samp> folder of the
									app.</p>

							</div>
</div>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">If these hints still don't help fix the problem in your app project, try downloading the solution of the current step or the next step of the
				tutorial from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app. This should get your project fixed again, just don’t forget to check the resource path
				and the project configuration files again.</p>
