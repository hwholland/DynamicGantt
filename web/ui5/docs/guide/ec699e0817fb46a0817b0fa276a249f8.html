	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This chapter and its sections describe the development concepts of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>, such as the
		Model View Controller, data binding, and components. Use this section as a reference.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Artifacts in the Framework</div><div type="Artifacts in the Framework">
			
			<p class="p">The top-level structural unit is called a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">library</span>. Libraries are the master artifacts in the extensibility concept. They
				bundle a set of controls and related types and make them consumable by Web applications. There are predefined and standard libraries, like
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp>, with many commonly used controls. At the same time, it treats custom UI libraries as first-class citizens, making it
				easy for you to write and use your own controls alongside the predefined ones.</p>

			<p class="p">A UI <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">element</span> is the basic building block of our user interfaces; it is a reusable entity with properties, events, methods,
				and relations. The most important relations are aggregations to other UI elements, and in this way a tree structure of elements can be
				created.</p>

			<p class="p">From a developer's point of view, a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">control</span> (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">Button</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">Label</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">TextField</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">Table</samp>) is the most important artifact. It is an object which controls the appearance and
				user interaction of a rectangular screen region. It is a special kind of user interface element which can be used as the root of such a tree
				structure. In this way, it serves as an entry point, especially for rendering. Besides controls, there are also other <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">non-control
					elements</span>, which cannot be used as the root of such a tree structure, but only as a dependent part within it (e.g.
					<samp class="ph codeph">TableRow</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">TableCell</samp>).</p>

			<p class="p">A <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">property</span> has a name and an associated data type. It has a well-defined default value expressed as a literal of that data
				type. Properties are accessible to application code via the element's API as getters and setters, but are also used by a control's renderer in a
				read-only way. </p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Data types</span> are first-class entities in the meta model. This allows reuse of types across libraries and extensibility of the
				type system. The core library (technically, this is the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp> library) already defines a core set of types that can be
				used in other libraries.</p>

			<p class="p">An <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">aggregation</span> is a special relation between two UI element types. It is used to define the parent-child relationship within
				the above mentioned tree structure. The parent end of the aggregation has cardinality 0..1, while the child end may have 0..1 or 0..*. The
				element's API offers convenient and consistent methods to deal with aggregations (e.g. to get, set, or remove target elements). Examples are
				table rows and cells, or the content of a table cell.</p>

			<p class="p">An <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">association</span> is another type of relation between two UI element types which is independent of the parent-child
				relationship within the above mentioned tree structure. Directed outgoing associations to a target of cardinality 0..1 are supported. They
				represent a loose coupling only and are thus implemented by storing the target element instance's ID. The most prominent example is the
				association between a label and its field.</p>

			<p class="p">An <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">event</span> has a name as well as any number of parameters. The element's API offers support to manage event subscriptions.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is a client UI technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. </p>

			<p class="p">Apps developed with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> run in a browser on any device (mobile, tablet or desktop
				PC). </p>

			<p class="p">When users access an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> app, a request is sent to the respective server to load
				the application into the browser. The view accesses the relevant libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business data is fetched
				from the database.</p>

			<p class="p">Depending on the environment in which <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is used, the libraries or your
				applications can be stored, for example, on an <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver Application Server</span> or an <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, and business data can be accessed, for example, using the OData model
				through a <span class="ph pname">SAP Gateway</span>.</p>
