				view could have the IDs <samp class="ph codeph">__view0--__page0</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">__view0--__table0</samp> at runtime.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>&lt;mvc:View

			<p class="p">These generated IDs change whenever the application’s control structure changes. This
				can cause problems to other functions when being used against your app:</p>

						your apps based on your requirements, for example, by creating your own
						variants or adapting the user interface at runtime. Stable IDs are used to
						identify the controls that are to be adapted.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Automated tests</span> check the behavior of the application at runtime. To do
						this, they find controls on a runtime screen by searching for stable IDs.
						The amount of stable IDs required depends on the chosen framework. If you
						use OPA in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>, you'll be able to find controls via other criteria like control type,
						display name and others. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="2696ab50faad458f9b4027ec2f9b884d.html" title="OPA5 is an API for SAPUI5 controls. It hides asynchronicity and eases access to SAPUI5 elements. This makes OPA especially helpful for testing user interactions, integration with SAPUI5, navigation, and data binding.">Integration Testing with One Page Acceptance Tests (OPA5)</a>.</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Inline help tools</span>
						 display application help directly in the application
						and might also depend on stable IDs.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">The solution for this is that application developers must set the IDs manually. For
				example, the page and the table in the following XML view would have the ID
					<samp class="ph codeph">myView--page</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">myView--table</samp> at runtime.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>&lt;mvc:View

         &lt;/Table&gt;
      &lt;/content&gt;
   &lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;</pre></div>

			<p class="p">The XML view prefixes the control IDs with its own ID. This allows you to use the
				same control ID on different views and to use the same view multiple times. For more
				information about this, see <a class="xref" href="91f28be26f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="Stable IDs are used to identify and modify the controls within the controller during runtime. However, if you reuse or nest these views, these stable IDs are no longer unique. To avoid ambiguity, each view adds its own ID as prefix to all its child controls.">Support for Unique IDs</a>
				(Note: In the case of JavaScript views, the view's <samp class="ph codeph">createID</samp> method
				needs to be used for this purpose).</p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">After a software upgrade, if some of the controls have disappeared or the way in
					which they can be identified has changed, this will have a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">direct
						impact</span> on functions such as <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span>
						flexibility services, </span>automated tests and inline help tools as outlined
					above. For this reason, these IDs <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">must</span> be kept stable over
					the lifecycle of the application. They are part of the public API of the
					application.</p>

			<p class="p">Ideally, you create your views with routing targets and declare the view ID in the

			<p class="p">When running multiple applications in a single html page, the stable ID needs to be

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Not Possible for Bound Aggregations</div><div type="Not Possible for Bound Aggregations">
			
			<p class="p">Because it's not actually possible to have stable IDs for controls in bound
				aggregations, you do not set IDs for such controls. For instance, the items in the
				table below are generated along the bound data and therefore cannot have stable
				IDs:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>&lt;mvc:View
   id="<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">myview</span>"
   xmlns="sap.m"

      id="<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">table</span>"
      items="{/ProductCollection}"&gt;
      &lt;items&gt;
         &lt;!-- no ID is set for controls in the bound 'items' aggregation --&gt;
         &lt;ColumnListItem/&gt;
            …
         &lt;/ColumnListItem&gt;
      &lt;/items&gt;
   &lt;/Table&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;</pre></div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">When Not to Set Stable IDs</div><div type="When Not to Set Stable IDs">
			
			<p class="p">Only set IDs on those controls that you want to be used by other functions like <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span>
					flexibility services, </span>automated tests or inline help tools . For instance, the layout control in the sample below could be
				assumed as not relevant:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!xml</samp>&lt;mvc:View
   xmlns="sap.m"
   xmlns:layout="sap.ui.layout"
   xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"&gt;
   &lt;Page <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">id="page"</span>&gt;
      &lt;content&gt;
         &lt;!-- no ID is set for this layout control --&gt;
         &lt;layout:HorizontalLayout&gt;
            &lt;Image src="..." id="firstImage"/&gt;
            &lt;Image src="..." id="secondImage"/&gt;
         &lt;/layout:HorizontalLayout&gt;
      &lt;/content&gt;
   &lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;</pre></div>

			<p class="p">Admittedly it's not always easy to decide if a stable ID is required. The best
				solution may therefore be to set IDs on each and every control, but remember you'll
				have to keep every one of those IDs stable.</p>
