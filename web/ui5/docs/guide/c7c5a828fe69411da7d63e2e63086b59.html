<p class="p">The value assigned to the role property
				for dimensions and measures in the annotation file determines the visualization of
				the chart. For dimensions, you can set the role to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">category</span> or
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">series</span>. If no value is specified, it's defaulted to

				detailed in the following section.</p>
<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Line Chart</span></p>

				<div class="p">Line charts require at least one measure and one dimension. <ul class="ul" id="loioc7c5a828fe69411da7d63e2e63086b59__ul_mvn_nlr_2v">
						<li class="li">Dimensions for which the role is set to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">category</span>,
							makes up the x-axis (category axis). If no dimension is specified with

							quarter, or year) for the category axis of a line chart.</li>

						<li class="li">Dimensions for which the role is set to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">series</span> make
							up the line segments of the chart, with different colors assigned to
							each dimension value. If multiple dimensions are assigned this role, the
							values of all such dimensions together are considered as one dimension
							and a color is assigned.</li>

						<li class="li">Measures make up the y- axis (value axis). If there are multiple
							measures, then each measure is represented by a different colored line

				<p class="p subsectiontitle">
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Donut Chart</span></p>

				<p class="p">Donut charts require exactly one measure. You can provide more than one
					dimension, in which case they are stacked so that the sections of the chart
					represent the combination of both dimensions. For example, if you define "Sales"
					as your measure, and provide two dimensions: "Year" and "Country", the chart
					will display the sales data of each combination of year and country as a
					separate colored section.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Bubble Chart</span></p>

				<div class="p">Bubble charts require three measures and at least one dimension, yet allow a

						<li class="li">The first measure for which the role is set to
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">axis1</span>, or if none exists, the first measure for
							which the role is set to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">axis2</span>, or if none exists,
							the first measure for which the role is set to
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">axis3</span>, is assigned to the feed UID
								<samp class="ph codeph">valueAxis</samp>. This makes up the X axis.</li>

						<li class="li">The first measure for which the role is set to

							the role is set to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">axis3</span> (if role
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">axis1</span> does not exist for the second measure),
							is assigned to the feed UID <samp class="ph codeph">valueAxis2</samp>. This makes up
							the Y axis.</li>

						<li class="li">The remaining measure is assigned to feed UID
								<samp class="ph codeph">bubbleWidth</samp>. This determines the size of the
							bubble.</li>

						<li class="li">The dimensions for which the role is set to <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">series</span>
							are assigned to the feed UID <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">color</span>. Different
							values for this dimension in the data set result in different colored
							data points in the chart. If multiples dimensions are set with the
							category role, only the first dimension is considered. If both
							dimensions have been assigned the role <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">series</span> then
							each combination of the dimension member will get a unique color. <div class="p">For
								example, if "Year" and "Country" are the dimensions and both have
								been assigned the role <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">series</span> then
								"India/2015", "India/2016", "Germany/2015", "Germany/2016" will be
								represented as a different colored bubble. If a dimension is not
								marked with any role, then the dimension members will get the same
								color. In the above example, if year is not marked with any color,
								then the bubbles will only have two colors - one for all records of
								India and one for all records of Germany, irrespective of the year.
									<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Assigning the role of a dimension as category would lead
									to different shaped data points for different values of the
									dimension. However, this is not recommended for a bubble chart
									card. Configuring the role of a bubble chart dimension as
									category is discouraged</div>
</div>
</li>

						<li class="li">The dimensions for which the role is set to
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">category</span> are assigned to the feed UID
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">shape</span>. Different values for this dimension in

							multiples dimensions are set with the category role, only the first
							dimension is considered.</li>
