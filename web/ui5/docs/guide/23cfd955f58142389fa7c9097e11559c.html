<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This section contains the practical part, details and best practices that will help you
		while developing your apps, and what pitfalls you should look out for along the
		way.</p>

		
		<p class="p">When faced with developing an app, you have several options available. <span class="ph">There
				are app templates, smart templates, or even a make-em-completely-from-scratch
				approach,</span> but what's the
			difference, and which one is right for your situation? Truth is, in most cases, it's
			your level of expertise or need for flexibility and freedom that will decide.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">App Templates</div><div type="App Templates">
			
			<p class="p">Think of the app templates described in this section as a kind of "best practice" for
				app development. They incorporate our latest recommendations and can be used for
				example as a starting point for developing apps according to the SAP Fiori Design
				Guidelines. They include generic application functionality and tests that can be
				easily extended with custom functionality if needed. As it stands, there are
				separate templates for Worklist and Master-Detail application patterns.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Building from Scratch</div><div type="Building from Scratch">
			
			<p class="p">If you're skilled at coding and want the most freedom and flexibility possible, then
				you'll probably think it's best to build an app completely from scratch. The
				downside of this is that for every few good ways there are to do some thing, there
				are countless other ways that really are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> the way to go,
				either because they'll cause headaches further down the line, or affect app
				performance, to name just two potential pitfalls. So in this section, we'll give you
				some guidance regarding the basic files you'll need in your app, and how to
				structure and name its various folders.</p>

			<p class="p">Regardless of whether you use app templates or build from scratch, there are some
				steps or concepts that are common to both. Throughout this section, we'll try to
				explain how to deal best with crucial concepts such as accessibility, security,
				device adaptation, and how you can speed up your app's performance for instance.
				Also be sure to check out things you really should avoid doing while coding. For
				more information, see <a class="xref" href="387787232c214b42954f18c93a28560a.html" title="This section lists some of the most important issues that should be avoided when creating applications using SAPUI5, split into different categories for reasons of simplicity.">Coding Issues to Avoid</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">One last thing, <span class="ph">although the
						<a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html">API Reference</a> within the Demo
					Kit</span> is your
				one-stop shop for in-depth control documentation, you'll also find some important
				control-related information in the sections that follow. This should hopefully help
				you when faced with decisions such as "which table control should I use?" or "what
				kind of busy indication suits my use case best?". For more about this, see <a class="xref" href="3ec6808ff0f34a75a9f40748cf9989b9.html" title="SAPUI5 contains controls that are provided with multiple libraries.">Control-Specific Information</a>.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Smart Templates</div><div type="Smart Templates">
			
			<p class="p">On the other hand, there are also smart templates. These can be used to create SAP
				Fiori applications based on OData services and annotations without the need for any
				JavaScript UI coding. Apps based on smart templates use central, predefined template
				views and controllers, so no application-specific view instances are required and
				consistent UI designs are guaranteed across similar apps. For more information about
				using smart templates to build your apps, see <a class="xref" href="03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd.html">Developing Apps with Smart Templates</a>.</p>
