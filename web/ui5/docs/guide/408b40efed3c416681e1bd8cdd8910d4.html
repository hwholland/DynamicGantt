	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If a Web app seems to have performance issues, finding out what's causing this can be
		both a time-consuming and nerve-consuming task. To help you avoid and maybe already solve
		performance issues in your app, here are some good practices we've discovered while dealing
		with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> apps. </p>

		<p class="p">When it comes to performance, it's often the case that an app is immediately considered to be
			slow. But this is only half of the truth. Sure, the app is what can be seen, but what
				<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">is</span> actually the app? It is the sum of its coding, retrieved and
			executed in a specific environment.</p>

		<p class="p">For <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> apps, we basically talk
			about JavaScript files sent to a client by a server and interpreted by the browser. So
			it's not only the coding of the app the can cause a slow performance. In many cases, it
			turns out that the configuration is wrong, for example. Slow networks or servers may
			also have a heavy impact on the performance of a Web app. Let's have a look at the most
			common issues.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Configuration</div><div type="Configuration">
			
			<div class="p">Issues with configuration are often caused by an old bootstrap or wrong usage of the activated
				features. Here's an example of what a bootstrap should look like for a modern <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> app:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!text/html</samp>&lt;script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
	src="<span class="ph">sapui5</span>/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
	data-sap-ui-libs="sap.m"
	data-sap-ui-theme="sap_bluecrystal"
	data-sap-ui-bindingSyntax="complex"
	data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge"
	<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">data-sap-ui-preload="async"</span>
	data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{
		"your.app": "yourDir/"
}'&gt;</pre></div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">For more information on bootstrap attributes, see <a class="xref" href="a04b0d10fb494d1cb722b9e341b584ba.html" title="To use SAPUI5 features in your HTML page, you have to load and initialize the SAPUI5 library.">Bootstrapping: Loading and Initializing</a>.</p>

				</div>
</div>

			<p class="p">The most important setting here is <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-preload="async"</samp>. This enables
				the runtime to load the modules for all declared libraries asynchronously in the
				background. This reduces the amount of requests sent by the client that could block
				each other.</p>

			<p class="p">Don't forget to implement the asynchronous behavior in the <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> event of the
				core as well, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint"><samp class="ph codeph">#!text/html</samp>&lt;script&gt;
sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(function() {
	sap.ui.require([
		"sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"
	], function(ComponentContainer) {
		sap.ui.component({
			<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">async: true</span>,
			name: "your.component"
		}).then(function(yourComponent) {
			new ComponentContainer({
				component: yourComponent
			}).placeAt("content");
		});
	});
});
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>

			</div>

			<div class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">async</samp> mode only pays out if all libraries that are required initially are
				specified in the <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-libs</samp> attribute of the bootstrap. If
				there are additional dependencies that are not listed (like transitive dependencies
				that are inherited from a listed library), <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> can load them
				automatically, but then <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> has to read the
				configured libraries first and find out about these dependencies, which also takes
				time. That's why we recommend adding these libraries explicitly to the bootstrap
				parameter <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-libs</samp> to achieve maximum parallelism.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">This does not apply for apps that have a descriptor file. In this case, only
						direct dependencies should be listed. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Network</div><div type="Network">
			
			<div class="p">If you want to quickly check the network load caused by your app, look at the developer tools
				of your browser, for example the <span class="ph uicontrol">Network</span> tab in the Google
				Chrome developer tools (<kbd class="key">F12</kbd>). You'll see an overview of all requests
				being sent. Possible issues here may be:<ul class="ul" id="loio408b40efed3c416681e1bd8cdd8910d4__ul_vlp_zmq_zt">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Synchronous requests that block each other</p>

						<p class="p">In this case use the <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-preload="async"</samp> setting
							in the bootstrap.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Amount of requests is too big</p>

						<p class="p">For  apps that use grunt as a Web
							server, you can use the <samp class="ph codeph">openui5_preload</samp> task to bundle
							and minimize all relevant files of a component. For more information,

			<div class="p">You can also optimize your coding by doing the following:<ul class="ul" id="loio408b40efed3c416681e1bd8cdd8910d4__ul_vvm_z4q_zt">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use non-blocking view loading as described here: <a class="xref" href="68d0e58857a647d49470d9f92dd859bd.html" title="To instantiate views, SAPUI5 provides the factory method sap.ui.view.">Instantiating Views</a></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If you make use of data binding with an OData service as a back end, you
							may also consider switching your OData model to our more modern V2 OData
							model. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2.html" title="The OData V2 Model enables binding of controls to data from OData services.">OData V2 Model</a></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Make use of asynchronous module loading (AMD style) for custom controls or other scripts. Although it is only supported by the
							preload, it will help us in future to enable asynchronous loading of individual modules combined with the usage of HTTP/2 or
							AMD-based packagers. It also ensures proper dependency tracking between modules.</p>

						<p class="p">Writing AMD modules is only half the story. You only need to avoid access to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> classes via global names. Do not use <samp class="ph codeph">new
								sap.m.Button()</samp>, but require the <samp class="ph codeph">Button</samp> and call the constructor via the local AMD reference. For more
							information, see the <span class="ph"><a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html#.define" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html#.define" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html#.define"> API Reference for <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.define</samp></a>
								in the Demo Kit.</span></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Avoid the usage of <samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout()</samp> calls with values greater than <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>. This usually indicates an anti-pattern in
							application code that is used as workaround and should be avoided. (See also <a class="xref" href="030fcd14963048218488048f407f8f34.html#loio030fcd14963048218488048f407f8f34__11">JavaScript Code Issues: Don't use timeouts</a>.)</p>
