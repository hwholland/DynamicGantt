}</pre></div>

			<p class="p">In the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.app</samp> section of the descriptor file, we add a data source
				configuration. With the <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp>, key we specify a
				configuration object that allows automatic model instantiation. We specify the type
				of the service (<samp class="ph codeph">OData</samp>) and the model version
				(<samp class="ph codeph">2.0</samp>). In this step, we want to use the publicly available
				Northwind OData service located at
					<span class="ph filepath">https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/</span>.
				Therefore, the URI points to the official Northwind OData service.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">We are referencing the Northwind OData service via HTTPS. However, the certificate might not
					be trusted. Thus, make sure that you call the URL
						<span class="ph filepath">https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/</span>
					directly in your browser and accept the certificate once, before you
					continue.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">In the <samp class="ph codeph">models</samp> section, we replace the content of the
					<samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp> model. This key is still used as model name when the
				model is automatically instantiated during the component initialization. However,
				the <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp> value of the <samp class="ph codeph">dataSource</samp> key is a
				reference to the data source section that we specified above. This configuration
				allows the component to retrieve the technical information for this model during the
				start-up of the app.</p>

			<p class="p">Our component now automatically creates an instance of
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel</samp> according to the settings we
				specified above, and makes it available as model named <samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp>. If
				you want to have a default model on the component, you can change the name of the
				model to an empty string in the descriptor file. Automatically instantiated models
				can be retrieved by calling <samp class="ph codeph">this.getModel</samp> in the component. In the
				controllers of component-based apps you can call
					<samp class="ph codeph">this.getView().getModel()</samp> to get the automatically instantiated
				model. For retrieving a named model you have to pass on the model name defined in
				the descriptor file to <samp class="ph codeph">getModel</samp>, this means, in the component you
				would call <samp class="ph codeph">this.getModel("invoice")</samp> to get our automatically
				generated <samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp> model that we defined in the descriptor. </p>

			<p class="p">When using the data source <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp>, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">ODataModel</samp> fetches the data from the real Northwind OData
				service. The invoices we receive from the Northwind OData service have identical
				properties as the JSON data we used previously (except for the
					<samp class="ph codeph">status</samp> propertythat is not available in the Northwind OData
				service).</p>

			<p class="p">You can now try to run the app and see what happens - we will see some errors in the
				browser’s console:</p>

			<div class="figcap">Violations of the same-origin policy in Google Chrome</div></div></div>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">Due to the so called same-origin policy, browsers deny AJAX requests to service
					endpoints in case the domain/subdomain, protocol, or port differ from the app’s
					domain/subdomain, protocol, or port.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">The browser refuses to connect to a remote URL directly for security reasons and we
				need a workaround.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"> For productive apps this approach is not recommended – we will describe
					the options later in this step.</span></p>

			<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
				<p class="p">In Google Chrome, you can easily disable same-origin policy of Chrome by running
					Chrome with the following command:
						<samp class="ph codeph">[here-your-path-to-chrome-installation-dir]\chrome.exe
						--disable-web-security</samp>. Make sure that all instances of Chrome are
					closed before you run the command above. This will allow all Web sites to break
					out of the same-origin policy and connect to the remote service directly.
						<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Be aware that it’s a security risk in case you run Chrome this way
						for surfing on the internet.</span> However, it also allows you to avoid
					the need of setting up a proxy at development time or for testing purposes</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">After disabling the same-origin policy in your browser, you can now run the app
				again. This time you can see all kinds of invoices retrieved from a real back end.
				In case you still have issues, just continue with the next step. There, we will
				switch to local mock data.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">In the component, we have added a dependency to
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel</samp>. The <samp class="ph codeph">v2</samp>
					in the namespace stands for the second version of the
						<samp class="ph codeph">ODataModel</samp> implementation in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>. This
						<samp class="ph codeph">v2</samp> is not related to the "OData Version 2" specification.
					We recommend suggested to use the new implementation
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel</samp> instead of the old
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.odata.ODataModel</samp> in your <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> apps.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Optional: Proxy Configuration to Avoid Same-Origin Policy Issues</div><div type="Optional: Proxy Configuration to Avoid Same-Origin Policy Issues">
			
			<p class="p"> In a real app scenario, the remote system would be configured to send the
				cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers to make the browser also allow direct
				access to remote URLs. However, we cannot modify the publicly available Northwind
				OData service. Thus, when trying to execute XHR requests
					(<samp class="ph codeph">XMLHttpRequest</samp>) the browser will prevent the call due to the
				so called same-origin policy as we have experienced above.</p>

			<div class="p">In order to overcome these issues, we have the following options:<ul class="ul" id="loio44062441f3bd4c67a4f665ae362d1109__ul_hgq_4dk_c5">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Deploy the app on the same server or domain as the service we want to
							call, so that both resources are in the same origin</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Set the CORS-relevant response headers on the remote system</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use a helper service from the same domain of our app as a proxy to call
							the real remote service</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Disable same-origin policy in the browser for local testing</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
 In the previous section we used the last approach which is not recommended for
				productive scenarios. </div>

			<p class="p">We will now switch to using a helper service as a proxy. For us, a proxy is simply a
				service end point on the same domain of our app to overcome the restrictions
				described above. It receives requests from our app, forwards them to another server,
				and finally returns the corresponding response from the remote service.</p>

			<p class="p">SAP Web IDE and the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> offer
				so-called destinations that allow to easily connect to remote systems. The
				destination to our Northwind OData service is an internet proxy made available
				inside the app at
					<span class="ph filepath">&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;domain&gt;/destinations/northwind/*</span>. Any
				request that is sent to this location will be forwarded to
					<span class="ph filepath">http://services.odata.org</span> automatically. </p>
