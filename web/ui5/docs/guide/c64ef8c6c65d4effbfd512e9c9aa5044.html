	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Overview pages provide quick access to vital business information at a glance, in the
		form of visual, actionable cards. Business users can focus on the most important tasks,
		enabling faster decision making as well as immediate action. Based on SAPUI5 technology,
		OData services and annotations, overview pages are a type of smart template, built and
		enhanced by developers. </p>

		<p class="p">Developers can build overview pages using a dedicated plugin in SAP Web IDE. End users
			then access overview pages from SAP Fiori launchpad, where each overview page is
			represented as a tile. End users can use a filter to narrow down the information
			displayed, or opt to hide cards when focusing on a particular topic. The displayed data
			is fully interactive, with clickable areas for easy navigation to relevant applications.
			Based on SAP Fiori, overview pages organize action items in an attractive and efficient
			way, with a fully responsive user interface.</p>

		<div class="p">The overview page application contains the following main components: <ul class="ul" id="loioc64ef8c6c65d4effbfd512e9c9aa5044__ul_myv_msf_rt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Application header: provides a description of the area for which this
						application provides an overview (for example, procurement or sales). From
						the header area, users can perform actions such as hiding cards, and showing
						or hiding the filter bar.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Smart filter: provides application-level filters for changing the levels of
						data displayed in the cards. For example, you could use the filter to
						display only transactions larger than $10,000, only items lighter than 50kg,
						and so on. For more information about the Smart Filter Bar, see <a class="xref" href="7bcdffc056a94731b4341db73251e32b.html" title="The sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar.SmartFilterBar control analyzes the $metadata document of an OData service and renders a FilterBar that can be used to filter a table.">Smart Filter Bar</a>.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Cards: a card is a smart component that uses UI annotation to render its
						content. Each card is bound to a single entity set in a data source.
						Different card types display different data in different ways: a card may
						display a donut or bar chart, or a table. Stack cards contain a set of quick
						view cards which can be viewed in an object stream. Cards are displayed on
						the overview page in up to five responsive columns and can be rearranged by
						dragging and dropping.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

		<p class="p">As a smart template application, the overview page is rendered according to information
			provided by the OData service metadata document, annotations files, and the
			configuration provided in the application manifest file. For more information about the
			Overview Page plugin, see <a class="xref" href="https://help.hana.ondemand.com/webide_ovp/frameset.htm?22042f4fecfe4c6eab0a1509c85d01ff.html" alt="https://help.hana.ondemand.com/webide_ovp/frameset.htm?22042f4fecfe4c6eab0a1509c85d01ff.html" title="https://help.hana.ondemand.com/webide_ovp/frameset.htm?22042f4fecfe4c6eab0a1509c85d01ff.html">SAP Fiori Overview Page Plugin for SAP Web IDE</a>. </p>

		<p class="p">Overview pages utilize smart template features. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd.html">Developing Apps with Smart Templates</a>.</p>
